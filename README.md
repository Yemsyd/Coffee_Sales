# Coffee Sales


## Project Overview
The primary aim of this project is to provide insight into the top-performing customers and determine which coffee types they enjoy drinking. By carefully considering every aspect of the project, we can make data-driven recommendations on how best to serve our customers and which coffee types need more production budget. The charts also highlight which countries bring the most sales. This way, we will know where we need to promote our products more and what other refinements we can employ to have a steady return in sales.

## Data Sources
The coffee sales data was collected from a YouTube channel since this is a guided project that helped me see how to start my personal project for my portfolio, and I enjoyed working on it. Thanks [Mo Chen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m13o5aqeCbM&t=131s&ab_channel=MoChen)
