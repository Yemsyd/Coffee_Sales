# Coffee Sales


## Project Overview
The primary aim of this project is to provide insight into the top-performing customers and determine which coffee types they enjoy drinking. By carefully considering every aspect of the project, we can make data-driven recommendations on how best to serve our customers and which coffee types need more production budget. The charts also highlight which countries bring the most sales. This way, we will know where we need to promote our products more and what other refinements we can employ to have a steady return in sales.

## Data Sources
The coffee sales data was collected from a YouTube channel since this is a guided project that helped me see how to start my personal project for my portfolio, and I enjoyed working on it. Thanks [Mo Chen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m13o5aqeCbM&t=131s&ab_channel=MoChen)

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Some business questions were expected to be answered to help the organization identify areas for improvement. While exploring this data, I found answers to the following questions.

1. Who are the top 5 best customers?
2. What are the total sales over a certain period?
3. Which of the coffee types do our consumers enjoy the most?
4. Which country had the best sales last year?

## Results/Findings
1. Our top 5 best customers are Allis Wilmore, Brenn Dundredge, Terri Farra, Nealson Cuttler, Don Flintiff. Allis Wilmore made the most purchase out of the top 5 with % 21.5 of our total sales.
Most of our best customers prefers the 2.5kg size of the coffee compared to other sizes. This indicate we can increase production for that size to meet demands of our premium customers.
2. The united states by far has the best sales in the previous year and our best customers are also from there. We should increase our marketing and production in other countries to boost sales especially
in United Kingdom and Ireland.
